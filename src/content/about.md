You probaly found this blog because of Blockstack's **Decentralized Summer** and want to track my progress.

* In case you don't know what Blockstack is, I'm sure you'd like to read [this intro](https://blockstack.org/intro) about it first.<br />
  **Spoiler**: It's a _really_ cool platform that enables developers to use a set of new progressive tools in their apps.
* In case you don't know what the Decentralized Summer is, [this announcement](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockstacks-decentralized-summer-tickets-34395687427) will help you.

**Tl;dr**: I'm one of three participants who develop an app the next two months that runs on Blockstack. I'll post every step I take here.

Tracking this blog should enable you to easily stay up to date with the development of [**Beacon**](/posts/hello-summer/). The goal is to help out with understanding and _especially_ reproducing the app development process, so that you're able to translate it to fit your own app.

If you're familiar with RSS, you can add https://blog.ntzwrk.org/tags/decentralized-summer/index.xml, everything I do for Blockstack's Decentralized Summer will appear there.

This blog is a **personal dev blog** and doesn't receive content or sponsoring from Blockstack (obviously except Decentralized Summer compensation).

---
Later on, we (the few people behind ntzwrk) like to transform this blog into a more general one, writing occasionally about things like

* security
* privacy
* decentralization
* programming

or maybe about something completely different. We hope to still see you in a couple months.
